                    <br> The Copernicus Reference System Software is a scalable and open-source processing chain.
		</p>
		<p>	
		    <br> It has been developed in AGILE since 2021 under Copernicus, a programme of the European Union implemented by the European Space Agency.
		</p>
		<p>	
                    <br> This Open-Source solution is today able to manage in parallel the image processing of all the Copernicus Sentinel 1, 2 and 3 (S1, S2 and S3) missions relying on Public Cloud scaling capabilities.

            <p>The Reference System Service (RS) is a key component of the CSC Ground Segment, because it provides to the community a complete and open source processing and distribution environment software. Integrated with the Sentinel Data Processors
                and running on a Commercial Public Cloud, it has the capacity to substitute the nominal CSC Production and Distribution services. Provided by ESA, all Sentinel Data Processors are integrated, validated and published in the frame of the
                Reference System Service.</p>
            <p>The Reference System Service is hosted on a secure Public Commercial Cloud and provides 3 operational functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>sampled systematic Production and Distribution Service;</li>
                <li>ad-hoc Production and Distribution Service;</li>
                <li>environment to assure the test, integration, validation, benchmarking of Sentinel Data Processors (new processor versions, new user level data, new Sentinel units).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <img class="schema" src="rsc/img/RS---context-schema-github.png ">
            <br>
            <p>This software is the exact complement of the ESA-driven Sentinel Data Processors. It provides all the components to integrate them in processing chains and to distribute the output products.</p>

		<br>The Reference System Software is an assembly of Free Open Source Softwares (FOSS) and ad hoc components developed during the project. The main drivers of the development are:
		<ul>
                    <li>
		        Designing a micro-service architecture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
		        Relying to state-of-the-art FOSS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
		        Making the solution scalable to meet the expected level of performance for each mission and processing level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
		        Creating a Cloud Agnostic solution capable of running on either a Public Cloud infrastructure or a Private Cloud.
                    </li>
                </ul>
		<br>At the system level, a first repository named 'Reference-System-Software' presents the system and details how to contribute and deploy the system. At the same system level, an 'Issues' repository is available to manage all issues related to RS Software.
        <br>
		<br>The system itself relies on Infrastructure components to host and run the Reference System Software. This part of the system also includes the Security components necessary to protect the system according to the associated security risk analysis.
		<br>
        <br>This platform takes as inputs the Copernicus S1, S2, and S3 data through each mission’s reception stations and the EDRS Ground Segment, as well as auxiliary data from ESA’s Auxiliary Data Gathering System. Based on these inputs, it uses two types of components to generate User Level Data within the expected timeliness:
        <br>
		<ul>
                    <li>
		        RS-Core  
                    </li>
		    <ul>
                Above the infrastructure some common components have been developed to support the processing of any mission. It includes all following features:
		        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
	                   <li>
			       Ingoing interfaces (ingestion chain).
		           </li>
	                   <li>
			       Outgoing interfaces (the products are made available to the external users through oDATA and STAC APIs).
		           </li>
	                   <li>
			       Data Catalog.
		           </li>
	                   <li>
			       Compression of data.
		           </li>
	                   <li>
			       Lifecycle management.
		           </li>
	                   <li>
			       Monitoring (necessary to operate the system).
		           </li>
	                   <li>
			       Error Management.
		           </li>
	                   <li>
			       User Web Client (for external users to see the production on a Map)
		           </li>
	               </ul>
		       <br>
	 	    </ul>   
                    <li>
			RS-AddOn 
                    </li>
		    <ul>
                The Instrument Processing Facilities (IPF) embeded in RS AddOns are provided by ESA.
                AddOns are used to describe each specific processing chain flow. They are a Spring Cloud Data Flow chain that embeds two kinds of processors:
		
		       <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
	                  <li>
	                     The Processor Unit: mainly trigger, prepare worker, router, filter.
		          </li>
	                  <li>
	                     The Data Processor Unit: mainly execution worker.
		          </li>
	              </ul> 
		      <br>The execution worker wraps Copernicus Sentinel Data Processor binaries and their static data. These AddOns are only accessible to users authorized by ESA, and the procedure to build them is available on GitHub. The Instrument Processing Facilities (IPF) embedded in RS AddOns are provided by ESA.
		   </ul>
		</ul>
		<br>The entire engineering and development phase has been collaboratively managed through a dedicated public Github Project, and all developments and associated documentation are publicly available under: <a href="https://github.com/COPRS">Github COPRS</a> 
		<br>
		<br>
                All components composing the system are available on GitHub with their associated documentation. GitHub and the system breakdown detailed in the figure allow understanding the design of the solution.
